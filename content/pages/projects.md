Student were assigned to do a course project on a subject of their choosing. The only constraint was that the subject had to involve the theme of the course (surface tension). Students were encouraged to pursue a subject that is not closely related to their doctoral research.

The course project was worth 50% of the course grade: 30% of it being based on the final paper, 20% on a 15 minute final presentation.

Listed below are the titles of the twenty course projects done by the students in the class, categorized according to 5 themes.
